pairup is an easy-to-use webapp that helps assign partners (with a possible team of three, if your class has an odd number of students). It also tries pretty hard to keep from assigning the same teams twice.

Originally for use in [C211](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/classes/c211/), now also used in [C212](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/classes/c212/).

Made of [GWT](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit) in the browser and Python on the server.
